    "The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). It contains 32 observations and 11 variables. A description of the variables is as follows:\n",
    "- mpg: Miles/(US) gallon\n",
    "- cyl: Number of cylinders\n",
    "- disp: Displacement (cu.in.)\n",
    "- hp: Gross horsepower\n",
    "- drat: Rear axle ratio\n",
    "- wt: Weight (1000 lbs)\n",
    "- qsec: 1/4 mile time\n",
    "- vs: Engine shape: (0 = V-shape, 1 = straight)\n",
    "- am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\n",
    "- gear: Number of forward gears\n",
    "- carb: Number of carburetors\n",

    "The objectives of this lab are to a) build a set of different regression models to predict the MPG given a set of features and 2) build a set of different classification models to classify cars into high-efficiency or low-efficiency vehicles.\n",

    "2. Build a classification model for classifying cars as high-efficient or low-efficient\n",
